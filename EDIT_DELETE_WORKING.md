## ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

### **Soft Delete vs Hard Delete:**

The delete button performs a **soft delete**:
- Sets `isActive = false`
- Facility stays in database
- Hidden from customers
- Can be reactivated

**To reactivate a deleted facility:**
```sql
UPDATE facilities 
SET "isActive" = true, "updatedAt" = NOW()
WHERE id = 'fac001';
```

### **Editing Price:**

The **Edit** page is where you change facility pricing! No need for a separate pricing page.
