```sql
INSERT INTO facilities (id, name, kind, description, capacity, price, photos, amenities, "isActive", "createdAt", "updatedAt")
VALUES 
  ('fac001', 'Deluxe Room 101', 'ROOM', 'Spacious room with ocean view', 2, 2500, 
   ARRAY['https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611892440504-42a792e24d32?w=800'], 
   ARRAY['WiFi', 'AC', 'TV', 'Mini Fridge'], true, NOW(), NOW()),
   
  ('fac002', 'Standard Room 102', 'ROOM', 'Cozy standard room', 2, 2000, 
   ARRAY['https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598928506311-c55ded91a20c?w=800'], 
   ARRAY['WiFi', 'AC', 'TV'], true, NOW(), NOW()),
   
  ('fac003', 'Family Cottage', 'COTTAGE', 'Perfect for families', 6, 5000, 
   ARRAY['https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566073771259-6a8506099945?w=800'],
