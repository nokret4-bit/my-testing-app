## 💡 Tips:

### **For Best Performance:**

**Use Image URLs (Option 2)** for:
- Large images
- Many images
- Production websites
- Better loading speed

**Use Upload (Option 1)** for:
- Quick testing
- Small images
- When you don't have image hosting

### **Recommended Image Sizes:**

- **Width:** 800-1200px
- **Format:** JPG or WebP
- **File size:** Under 500KB each

### **Free Image Hosting:**

If you want to use URLs instead of uploads:
- **Unsplash** - https://unsplash.com (free stock photos)
- **Imgur** - https://imgur.com (free image hosting)
- **Cloudinary** - https://cloudinary.com (free tier available)

---

## 🔧 How It Works:

### **Uploaded Images:**
- Converted to Base64 format
- Stored directly in database
- No external hosting needed
- Embedded in HTML

### **URL Images:**
- Stored as text URLs
- Loaded from external servers
- Faster database queries
- Requires internet connection

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### **Base64 Images:**
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Work offline
- ❌ Larger database size
- ❌ Slower page loads with many images

### **URL Images:**
- ✅ Smaller database
- ✅ Faster page loads
- ❌ Requires external hosting

1. **Edit the facility**
2. **Upload 2-3 photos** from your computer
3. **Or paste Unsplash URLs:**
