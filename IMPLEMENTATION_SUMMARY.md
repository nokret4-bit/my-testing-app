## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_login_logs_and_staff_permissions
```

### 2. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test All Features

- Test booking checker on home page
- Test login logging
- Create a test staff account
- Test editing and deleting bookings

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Login Logs: ADMIN only
   - Staff Management: ADMIN only
   - Edit/Delete Bookings: ADMIN only
   - Staff can only access features based on their permissions

2. **Audit Logging:**
   - All staff creation/updates/deletions are logged
   - All booking edits/deletions are logged
   - Login attempts (success and failure) are logged

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Cannot delete your own admin account
   - Booking deletions cascade to related records
   - Failed login attempts are tracked for security monitoring

---

## API Endpoints Summary

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/bookings/lookup?code=XXX` - Lookup booking by code

### Admin-Only Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/staff` - Create staff account
- `PATCH /api/admin/staff/[id]` - Update staff account
- `DELETE /api/admin/staff/[id]` - Delete staff account
- `PATCH /api/admin/bookings/[id]` - Edit booking
- `DELETE /api/admin/bookings/[id]` - Delete booking

---

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Home Page:**
   - Added prominent Booking Checker section
   - Clean, user-friendly interface for entering booking codes

2. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Added Staff Management and Login Logs cards (admin only)
   - Responsive grid layout

3. **Reservations Page:**
   - Edit and Delete buttons for each booking (admin only)
   - Clear visual separation between actions

4. **Modal Dialogs:**
   - All create/edit/delete actions use modal dialogs
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Loading states for better UX

---

## Permissions System

Staff permissions are stored as JSON in the User model:

```json
{
  "view_bookings": true,
  "manage_bookings": true,
  "view_facilities": true,
  "manage_facilities": false,
  "view_reports": true,
  "manage_pricing": false
}
```

Admin users have full access regardless of permissions.
